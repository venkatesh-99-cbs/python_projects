🎓 Student Progress System (Python – OOPS)
📌 Project Overview

The Student Progress System is a Python-based application developed using Object-Oriented Programming (OOPS) concepts.
It is designed to manage and track student academic performance, including marks, grades, attendance, and overall progress.

This system helps institutions and students monitor performance efficiently and demonstrates real-world usage of OOPS concepts.
