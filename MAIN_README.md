📂 Project Summary

This Python project is developed using Object-Oriented Programming (OOPS) principles and follows a modular folder structure.
Each module is organized into separate files and folders, with clear documentation to ensure readability, scalability, and easy maintenance.

The project demonstrates how Python can be used to build real-world systems such as academic management and basic automation tools.

🧱 Project Organization

Each feature is placed in its own folder

Every folder contains a dedicated README.md

Each Python file includes clear docstrings

The root README provides a high-level overview
